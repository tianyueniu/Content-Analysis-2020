# Evolution of Psychology Research  
#### Final Project
**Computational Content Analysis**   
**Spring 2020**

In this final project, we explored the changes in past research trends using PubMed publication data that is readily accesible from PubMed database. In particular, we focused on psychology-related PubMed articles. Psychology has many different divisions, including but not limited to abnormal psychology,neuroscience, cognition, early development, etc. By analyzing publications content, we will be able to learn more about past research trends. We believe this is interesting and meaningful to look into because 1) with this result, psychologists can concentrate their research efforts on certain domains to make larger collective progress, 2)the change in focus in psychology can also be reflective of changes in cultural trend (e.g. how we view psychologically abnormal patients, or are we focusing more on self-care than in the past, etc), which can have significant sociological or economic implications. 
        
Given the background, the questions that we aim to answer with this project is 'How has the focus of psychological research changed in the last 50 years?'

We answered this question by performing:

1) Topic Modeling Analysis: look at macro changes in research focus in the past 5 decades
2) Word Embedding Analysis: look at changes in our understanding of specific topics in the past 5 decades
3) Network Analysis: focus on Alzheimer, evaluate the progresses made in in Alzheiemr research
4) Text Generation: examine if corpora built from different period's data would generate different psuedo abstract.

Large scale computing techniques (Apache Spark & Amazon EMR) were used to perform the above analyses.
